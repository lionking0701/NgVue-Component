# Simple Examples

Here we provide two simple examples on the `vue-component` directive and the `createVueComponent` factory.

## How

In the root directory, run `npm install` to install the dependencies and then run `npm run dev-example`. Webpack will bundle the files and run a dev server on the port `12345`, so you could open `http://localhost:12345/vue-component/` for the `vue-component` directive and `http://localhost:12345/create-vue-component/` for the `createVueComponent` factory.
